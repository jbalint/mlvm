This package includes code of assembler for MLVM.

We try to design the program wrt the following rules:

1) do whatever can be done to make the loader simple and fast.

2) consider run-time symbol table expansion, for example, an
imago might receive a message where some symbolic terms were
not in its symbol table.

3) the file format should be designed as consistent as possible to
the format of a moving imago.

4) do not consider dynamic consulting (loading).

File format:

		--------------------
		|    magic #       |  something like JAVA class magic number
		|------------------|
		|    ima type      |  {stationary, worker, messenger}
		|------------------|
		|    security      |  to be decided (temporarily 0)
		|------------------|
		|    sym size      |  size of symbol table (unit in bytes)
		|------------------|
		|    pro size      |  size of procedure table (two words each: name, entry}
 		|------------------|
		|    code size     |  size of byte code
 		|------------------|
		|                  |
		| symbol table     |  aligned 4 for each symbolic constant
		|                  |  note: single char is handled differently
		|------------------|
		|        |         |  free space (can be expanded)
		|        v         |
		|------------------|
		|  pro table       |  procedure table
 		|------------------|
		|                  |
		|    code          |  byte code
		|                  |
