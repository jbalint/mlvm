Introduction:
The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight transport protocol for the 
new MLVM (Multi-threaded Lightweight Virtual Machine) designed by Dr. Xining Li.

Approach:
Imago Control Blocks (ICB) travel from virtual machine to virtual machine usually
located on different hosts. The transport protocol must be reliable, secure and 
fool proof. The reliability is provided by the "imago routing" layer while the
security issue is been addressed for later study. Some sckeleton is implemented 
to ease the designed of new layers while building up the complete server application.
A minimum information is required from the Imago Agent in order to sucessfully 
contact the destination MLVM. This minimum is represented by a URL or the form:
"sitp://draco.cis.uoguelph.ca:2222". Where the protocol field (sitp) is one of the 
following: "sitp", "sicp", "any" which stands for "Simple Imago Transport Protocol"
"Simple Imago Control Protocol" and "any protocol" in order. User level Imagos
simply need to use the SITP protocol as it is provided for transport of Imago.
Others protocol are used for communication between servers and receiving just
about anything. The transport stack is constructed on top of the regulard BSD 
Socket interface and as of now, contains four (4) layers. From bottom to top,
with the bottom been on top of the BSD Sockets. The connection layer, routing 
layer, security layer, Marshalling/Umarshalling layer. The connection layer as
for main task to open, maintain and terminate a point-to-point connection between
two hosts. Later on, SSL encryption will be added to this layer for security 
purposes. The routing layer is here to establish a connectionless source to 
destination route. Gateway servers not interested on running and Imagos may
implement a simple server including only those two layers. The security layer
will implement some source to destination encryption algorithm. It has not been 
yet found any reliable and fault proof algorithm for Mobile-Agent systems but
never-the-less, hooks and skeleton are provided so later study may implement
the security. The top most layer (marshalling/umarshalling) prepares the ICB for
the transmission. Compacting, pointer relocation and eventually compression of 
the ICB is done at the very begining in this layer.
