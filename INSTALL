1. Prerequisites
----------------

You will need working installations of OpenSSL if you decide to use encryption and signature (default).

OpenSSL 0.9.6 or greater:
http://www.openssl.org/

Also, this is Linux software that has been tested under Mandrake 8.2, RedHat 7.3 and RedHat 8.0.
Please, let me know if you succeeded compiling and running the server under other OS.

The GUI client requires Java 1.4.0 or better.


2. Building / Installation
--------------------------

To install MLVM with default options:

./configure
make
(su root)
make install

This will install the MLVM binary in /usr/local/bin, configuration files
in /usr/local/etc/mlvm, the server in /usr/local/sbin, etc. To specify a different
installation prefix, use the --prefix option to configure:

./configure --prefix=/opt
make
(su root if required)
make install

Will install MLVM in /opt/{bin,etc,lib,sbin}. You can also override 
specific paths, for example:

./configure --prefix=/opt --sysconfdir=/etc
make
(su root)
make install

This will install the binaries in /opt/{bin,lib,sbin}, but will place the
configuration files in /etc/mlvm.

If you need to pass special options to the compiler or linker, you
can specify these as environment variables before running ./configure.
For example:

CFLAGS="-O -m486" LDFLAGS="-s" LIBS="-lrubbish" LD="/usr/foo/ld" ./configure

3. Configuration
----------------

The runtime configuration files are installed by in ${prefix}/etc/mlvm or 
whatever you specified as your --sysconfdir (/usr/local/etc/mlvm by default).

The default configuration should be instantly usable, though you should 
review it to ensure that it matches your security requirements.

The server will automaticaly generate a host key at the first start.

For more information on configuration, please refer to the manual pages 
for mlvmd and mlvmc (not supported yet :).

4. Problems?
------------

If you experience problems compiling, installing or running MLVM.
Please refer to the "reporting bugs" section of the webpage at
